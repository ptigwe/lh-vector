lh-vector
=========

The Lemke Howson algorithm simulated with the use of covering vectors.

Changes:
============
- Added an extra description for rational numbers using the GNUMP library
  to provide a rational number with integer values for the numerator and
  denominator of arbitrary length.
- An extra make rule was added to compile the program for the GNUMP
  library.

_'make inlh'_ -- Compiles the program using the provided mp library

_'make inglh'_ -- Compiles the program using the GMUMP library
