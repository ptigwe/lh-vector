lh-vector
=========

The Lemke Howson algorithm simulated with the use of covering vectors.

Changes:
============
- Added two methods for initializing the first set of pivots for the
  Lemke-Howson algorithm.
- By default the first method for initialization is used, an extra
  flag was added '-m' to specify that the second method should be
  used.
